# ProfMath
The ProfMajor™️ Order — A Mathematical Journey into the Universe

**ProfMath** is a personal library by Prof. Ramesh V, built from first principles, rethinking matrix operations, tensors, and arithmetic in Java from scratch.

### Features (2025–2030 Roadmap)
- The ProfMajor™️ Order (Row-Major, Reversed Loops)
- Tensors with Generics
- LU Decomposition
- Eigenvalue Computation
- Tensor Rank Detection
- Handcrafted Arithmetic without external libraries

### Why ProfMath?
Because the journey matters more than the destination — and every journey begins with a single **scalar**.
